                    | The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is a classic stress assessment instrument. The tool, while originally
                    | developed in 1983, remains a popular choice for helping us understand how different situations affect
                    | our feelings and our perceived stress. The questions in this scale ask about your feelings and thoughts
                    | during the last month. In each case, you will be asked to indicate how often you felt or thought a certain
                    | way. Although some of the questions are similar, there are differences between them and you should
                    | treat each one as a separate question. The best approach is to answer fairly quickly. That is, donâ€™t try to
                    | count up the number of times you felt a particular way; rather indicate the alternative that seems like
                    | a reasonable estimate.

                h3 How it is scored
                p
                    | Each questionnaire answer has following score:
                    br
                    |                 0 - never, 1 - almost never, 2 - sometimes, 3 - fairly often, 4 - very often,
                    |                 except for questions 4, 5, 7, 8. They all have reversed score.
                    br
                    |                 Depending on total score, you get under
                    |                 one of three categories with low, moderate or high stress perception.

                h3 Different score
                p
                    | The Perceived Stress Scale is interesting and important because your perception of what is happening
                    | in your life is most important. Consider the idea that two individuals could have the exact same events
                    | and experiences in their lives for the past month. Depending on their perception, total score could put
                    | one of those individuals in the low stress category and the total score could put the second person in
                    | the high stress category
